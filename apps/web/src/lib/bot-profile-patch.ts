 * Bot settings edit one Description field that also feeds the bot's
 * instructions, which hold far more text than a description may. Send both
 * only when that field itself changed: saving another setting must not
 * overwrite longer instructions, and a stored description above the
 * description limit must not fail every save. An edit is clamped to each
 * field's own limit, the same way a new bot's profile is derived.
 *
 * The panel trims the field before saving, so the stored value is compared
 * trimmed as well: stray whitespace around a stored description is not an
 * edit and must not drag the instructions along.
 *
 * `stored` is the description last saved from this panel, not a bot prop that
 * may still be stale when a roster refresh skips replacing the list.
